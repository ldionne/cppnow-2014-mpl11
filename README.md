This repository contains my presentation for C++Now 2014.

The presentation is based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Basic usage
Go to https://ldionne.github.io/cppnow-2014-mpl11 or open index.html with
your browser. The PDF slides are also available in the `slides.pdf` file.

## Advanced usage
```sh
    npm install # may take a little while
    grunt serve &
```
Then connect to `localhost:8000` to view locally.
